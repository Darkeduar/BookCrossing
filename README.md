# BookCrossing

This is a paltform that allows users to create their virtual library and exchange their books with others. You can set your library to be public or private (other people will see it or not, either way you are the only one that can make changes) and mark your books as "available for exchange". All marked books are visible to everyone in the marketplace. Users can send messages to eachother and if they decide to exchange their books, they will be swapped in their libraries.
